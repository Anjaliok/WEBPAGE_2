**Project Title:**
Frontend-Only Ticket Booking System

**Description:**
The Frontend-Only Ticket Booking System is a lightweight, browser-based application designed to simulate the process of viewing and booking tickets for events. 
It provides users with a simple and intuitive interface to explore available events, check ticket availability, and make bookings. 
All functionality is implemented entirely on the client side using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without the need for a backend or database.
This project is suitable for showcasing basic web development skills, especially dynamic content rendering, user interactivity, and responsive design.

**Key Features:**
1. Event Listing:
Displays a list of events with details such as name, description, and available tickets.
Dynamically renders the event data in the browser.

2. Ticket Booking:
Allows users to select an event and book a specific number of tickets.
Automatically updates the availability of tickets after a successful booking.

3. Dynamic Feedback:
Displays appropriate messages if no events are available.
Provides real-time updates on ticket availability.

4. User-Friendly Interface:
Uses Bootstrap for a responsive and clean design.
Ensures the application is accessible on devices of various screen sizes.

5. Frontend-Only Functionality:
All logic is handled in the browser using JavaScript.
Data is stored temporarily in the browser's memory (using JavaScript arrays).

**The Frontend-Only Ticket Booking System is built using the following technologies:**
1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
Used for creating the structure and layout of the web application.
Defines elements like headings, buttons, and containers to display content.

2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
Used for styling and layout of the application.
Enhances the visual appearance of the web pages.
Bootstrap (CSS framework) is used for responsive design and pre-styled components.

3. JavaScript:
Used for dynamic content rendering and interactivity.
Handles event booking logic, updates ticket availability, and provides feedback to the user.
Manages all client-side operations, such as updating the UI and processing user inputs.

4. Bootstrap (CSS Framework):
Provides pre-styled components like buttons, cards, and grids.
Ensures the application is mobile-friendly and responsive across different screen sizes.
Makes it easier to design consistent and modern interfaces without writing custom CSS.

Optional Future Technologies (For Expansion):
If you want to extend the project, you could include:
1. LocalStorage or IndexedDB: For storing data locally in the browser.
2. Backend Technologies: For adding a server-side component (e.g., Node.js with Express).
3. Database: For persistent storage of events and bookings (e.g., MongoDB or MySQL).

Why These Technologies?
This tech stack was chosen for simplicity, ease of use, and to demonstrate basic web development concepts that can run directly in the browser without additional setup.
